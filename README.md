# Projects – Deep Learning & Machine Learning  
**Author: Santiago Santafé**

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects developed during my studies and self-learning.  
It demonstrates my skills in **Python, data processing, signal analysis, and ML/DL frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch basics)**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

While the repo includes a broad range of projects (classification, tabular data, deep learning exercises), I am especially focused on applying AI to **experimental data, signal processing, and pattern recognition** — skills directly relevant for research and industry applications (e.g., in high-precision measurement instruments).

## 🌟 Highlighted Projects

### 🔊 Clasificación de Audio
- **Goal**: classify audio signals using feature extraction and ML models.  
- **Skills demonstrated**: signal processing, feature engineering (MFCCs), supervised learning.  
- **Relevance**: strong overlap with processing of measurement signals (pattern recognition, noise handling).

### ⚙️ ProyectoPipe
- **Goal**: build an end-to-end ML pipeline (data prep → model training → evaluation).  
- **Skills demonstrated**: modular coding, reproducibility, automation mindset.  
- **Relevance**: shows ability to structure AI workflows for robust application.

### 🧬 Cáncer de mama (MP-Network)
- **Goal**: classify medical data for cancer diagnosis.  
- **Skills demonstrated**: preprocessing tabular data, building and training neural networks.  
- **Relevance**: demonstrates application of ML to healthcare / experimental contexts.

## 🆕 Planned Project: Measurement Demo
- **Goal**: process synthetic x-y measurement curves, detect peaks, extract features, classify patterns, and detect anomalies.  
- **Methods**: Savitzky-Golay filtering, using some methods for classification that i've used before as RandomForest classification, IsolationForest anomaly detection.  
- **Output**: reproducible pipeline with notebooks + scripts.  

*(This project will be added soon in `/MeasurementDemo`.)*
